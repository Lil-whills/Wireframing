# 📐 Wireframing in Software Development

Wireframing is a crucial step in the software design process. It serves as a **visual guide** that represents the skeletal framework of a digital product. Wireframes are used to layout **content**, **functionality**, and **navigation**, allowing designers, developers, and stakeholders to align on structure before investing time in high-fidelity design or development.

## 🔑 Key Elements of Wireframing

Here are the core components commonly found in wireframes:

### 🧱 **Layout Structure**
Defines the arrangement of major elements like headers, footers, and content blocks.  
*Example:*  
A homepage wireframe might have a hero image at the top, followed by three service cards below.

### 🧭 **Navigation**
Represents how users will move through the product using menus, tabs, or sidebar links.  
*Example:*  
A top navigation bar with links to **Home**, **Bookings**, and **Contact**.

### 📝 **Content Placement**
Shows where text, images, and media will appear using placeholder boxes.  
*Example:*  
Sections labeled **"Image here"**, **"Title here"**, or **"Form goes here"**.

### ⚙️ **Functionality**
Outlines interactive components like buttons, forms, and dropdowns.  
*Example:*  
A **“Book Now”** button under each property listing.

## 🧾 Types of Wireframes

Wireframes come in two main styles:

### 🔹 **Low-Fidelity Wireframes**

- Focuses on structure, not visuals
- **Used in early-stage planning**

### 🔸 **High-Fidelity Wireframes**
- Detailed, pixel-precise, and closer to final UI
- Includes colors, typography, and actual UI components
- **Used in later design stages**
